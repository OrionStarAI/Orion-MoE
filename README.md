# 1. Model Introduction

- Orion-MoE8x7B is a pretrained foundation large language model with a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. The model is trained from scratch on a multilingual corpus comprising approximately 5 trillion tokens, including launguages such as Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and more.

- Key Features of Orion-MoE8x7B
  - The model demonstrates exceptional performance in comprehensive evaluations compared to other models of the same parameter scale.
  - The model excels in multilingual benchmarks, significantly outperforming in Japanese and Korean test sets, and also performing strong results in Arabic, German, French, and Spanish evaluations.
  - Leveraging its sparse MoE structure, the model achieves faster inference speeds compared to dense models of similar scale.

- Training hyper-parameters
  - We use the AdamW optimizer with hyperparameters set to ùõΩ1 = 0.9, ùõΩ2 = 0.95, and a weight decay of 0.1.
  - Training begins with a learning rate warm-up phase over 2000 iterations, where the learning rate is linearly increased to a peak of 3e-4. Afterward, a cosine schedule is applied to gradually reduce the learning rate to 3e-5 over the course of training.
  - The model is trained using BF16/FP32 mixed precision, with a batch size of 2600, processing approximately 22 million tokens per step.

- Data Distribution
  - The training dataset is primarily composed of English, Chinese, which together account for over 75% of the total data. The remaining dataset includes other languages, programming code, mathematical data, etc. A detailed breakdown of the topic distribution is provided in the table below.

### 3.5. Leakage Detection Benchmark
When the pre-training data of a large language model contains content from a specific dataset, the model‚Äôs performance on that dataset may be artificially enhanced, leading to inaccurate performance evaluations. To address this issue, researchers from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other institutions have proposed a simple and effective method for detecting data leakage. This method leverages the interchangeable nature of multiple-choice options by shuffling the options in the original dataset to generate derived data. The log-probability distribution of the derived dataset is then computed using the model to detect whether the original dataset has been leaked.

We conducted data leakage detection experiments on three benchmark datasets: MMLU, CMMLU, and C-Eval.<br>
More details can be found in the paper: https://web3.arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01790.<br>
Test code: https://github.com/nishiwen1214/Benchmark-leakage-detection.

# 4. Model Inference

Model weights, source code, and configuration needed for inference are published on Hugging Face, and the download link
is available in the table at the beginning of this document. We demonstrate various inference methods here, and the
program will automatically download the necessary resources from Hugging Face.

## 4.1. Python Code

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from transformers.generation.utils import GenerationConfig

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("OrionStarAI/Orion-MoE8x7B",
                                          use_fast=False,
                                          trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("OrionStarAI/Orion-MoE8x7B",
                                             device_map="auto",
                                             torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
                                             trust_remote_code=True)

model.generation_config = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained("OrionStarAI/Orion-MoE8x7B")
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, what is your name? "}]
response = model.chat(tokenizer, messages, streaming=False)
print(response)

```

In the above Python code, the model is loaded with `device_map='auto'` to utilize all available GPUs. To specify the
device, you can use something like `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` (using GPUs 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7).

## 4.2. Direct Script Inference

```shell

# foundation model
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 python demo/text_generation_base.py --model OrionStarAI/Orion-MoE8x7B --tokenizer OrionStarAI/Orion-MoE8x7B --prompt hello

```
## 4.3. vLLM Inference Service
Download project(https://github.com/OrionStarAI/vllm_server), follow the instructions to build up the vLLM service docker image.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:OrionStarAI/vllm_server.git
cd vllm_server
docker build -t vllm_server:0.0.0.0 -f Dockerfile .
```
Start docker service
```shell
docker run --gpus all -it -p 9999:9999 -v $(pwd)/logs:/workspace/logs:rw -v $HOME/Downloads:/workspace/models -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 -e MODEL_DIR=Orion-MoE8x7B -e MODEL_NAME=orion-moe vllm_server:0.0.0.0
```
Run inference
```shell
curl http://0.0.0.0:9999/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model": "orion-moe","temperature": 0.2,"stream": false, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content":"Which company developed you as an AI agent?"}]}'
```
